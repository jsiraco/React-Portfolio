                    My name is Josef and I'm an aspiring full-stack web developer. My preferred stack is MERN,
                    but I'm open to learning any and every technology I can. My hobbies include hiking, cooking and going to the museum.
                    I'm a big fan of large cats and small dogs and give everything I do 100%. Here you will find some of my recent projects.
